# Price Line Alert

Price Line Alert is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It doesn't use any standard indicators. Its main purpose is to offer a simple yet powerful tool to place horizontal lines on the chart and to issue alerts when those lines get hit by the price.

It includes a graphical interface that can be dragged directly on the chart.

It supports notifications via email, mobile, and the platform's popup window.
